💰 **Loan Price Prediction Using Machine Learning**

Welcome to the Loan Price Prediction project — where machine learning meets finance! 🧠📈
This project aims to predict whether a loan will be approved based on applicant details using ML models. It demonstrates how data science can streamline loan approval processes in the financial sector. 🏦

📌 Project Overview
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict loan approval outcomes using structured customer data from a financial institution.
By analyzing features like income, loan amount, education, and more — it offers insight into risk assessment and credit evaluation.

🎯 Objectives
✅ Load and preprocess the dataset
✅ Handle missing values and categorical variables
✅ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
✅ Train classification models
✅ Evaluate performance using precision, recall, and accuracy
✅ Visualize results and important features

🔍 Key Insights
Applicants with higher income and strong credit history are more likely to get loans approved.

Married graduates from semi-urban areas have higher approval rates.

Missing value imputation and encoding significantly affect prediction accuracy.
