# 💰 Loan Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on various applicant attributes such as income, education, employment status, credit history, and more. The goal is to assist financial institutions in making faster and more accurate loan approval decisions using data-driven insights.

🔍 Key Insights
Applicants with a credit history have a significantly higher approval rate.

Higher income does not always lead to loan approval unless supported by good credit.

Property area and education level also play roles in loan status.

🌟 Future Enhancements
🖥 Deploy model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

📱 Integrate into a mobile loan approval assistant

🧠 Use XGBoost/LightGBM for higher accuracy

🔍 Add SHAP values for model interpretability
